Refined Elevator Pitch

This app is for customers who want a better dice rolling experience in a basic, web based format. This dice roller will have a visual representation which will allow a user to select a number and type of dice and then roll them, and will also allow for persistant rolls between refreshes.

This will be an app for people that need a simple, to the point dice roller that works well and presents a nice visual representation of the dice. 

Three risks that we can encounter during development are:

    1: Going too far in our scope, not specifying enough and taking on more work then we can handle in the time allotted. It's easy to get lost in trying to add features, instead of refining the ones that you already have. We are going to mitigate this risk by carefully defining our scope, our requirements and capabilities. If there are features that are optional, we can include them in the user stories and attempt them after the main work is done.

    2: Another risk is overlapping commits, we are working with a git based project and if people are making changes without getting pull updates first, there could be conflicting commits. Our group's plan is to have good commuinication around changes, and also use pull requests to better seperate commits and make sure we aren't writing over each other's work. Another way to mitigate this risk is to have certain people work on certain parts of the site, so that we have separate roles.

    3: Finally, a third risk

Essential features include:
